        "Member of the development team and mentored by Felix Amaya Valencia, from whom I quickly gained recognition and was assigned tasks of the same weight as those given to permanent members of the team. I was responsible for designing several modules of the ERP system and some sections of the company's database. Working there taught me to have a larger scale vision of a system and to understand the importance of knowing a problem in depth before writing even one line of code trying to solve it."

        "Originally tasked to be an assistant in technical support and server administration, I ended up doing all the engineering process to develop an Android application. During the time I was providing support, I learned to gather and interpret information about the experience of using software by users with little or no computer knowledge. During the development of the application I learned about modern software design architectures (MVVM and observer pattern), how to reverse engineer an existing system to integrate it to another with zero documentation, how to implement a REST API with PHP and Laravel, as well as how to secure the requests to the server through JSON Web Tokens."

        "I was in charge of developing and maintaining several solutions, the main one being the TimbraXML billing web application. It was the first time I felt I contributed things to a development team: good solutions for complex developments, turning repetitive processes into documented libraries, good flows with Git and promoting the use of modern and more readable syntax. Besides gaining a lot of knowledge of frontend and backend web development, I learned what is a good workflow among a development team, supported by version control tools, progression boards and effective communication channels."
