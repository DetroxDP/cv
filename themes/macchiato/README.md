# Macchiato Theme! ‚òïÔ∏è+ü•õ

(This is a forked and slightly modified version of) Macchiato it's a [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) theme based on [Theme Boilerplate](https://github.com/jsonresume/jsonresume-theme-boilerplate) and [Caffeine Theme](https://github.com/kelyvin/jsonresume-theme-caffeine).

## Why?

I needed to modify some style of my favorite resume theme [Macchiato
Ibic](https://github.com/houtianze/jsonresume-theme-macchiato-ibic), so I
decided to create this fork to be my personal custom version üôÇ. I'm not the
creator of this theme, so all the credits goes for Alessandro Biondi (the
original creator) and HOU Tianze (the creator of Macchiato Ibic). I'll leave the
following README content as it is.


## Changes from Caffeine Theme

### Environment

- Simpler and less sofisticated development environment, the same as JSON Resume boilerplate. (Caffeine has live re-building and automatic page reloading)


### Visual differences

- Add tags to projects and skills
- Switch from `UPPERCASE` to `Capitalize` on most text

## Changes from Macchiato Theme

Mainly on `projects`:

- Use `name` instead of `title` as per `jsonresume` schema
- Add `description` sections for each project

## Usage

1. Download [JSON Resume CLI](https://jsonresume.org/)
  ```
  npm install -g resume-cli
  ```

2. Download the theme from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
  ```
  npm install -g jsonresume-theme-macchiato
  ```

3. Use resume cli to build your resume
  ```
  resume export resume.html --theme macchiato
  ```

### PDF output

Probably you want a PDF version of your resume...

JSONResume CLI should be able to make a PDF out of your JSON but I always struggled to get it to work,
so I switched to a more direct and effective approach.

I use Puppeteer-CLI to make a PDF from my HTML resume.

```
npm install -g puppeteer-cli
puppeteer --margin-top 0 --margin-right 0 --margin-bottom 0 --margin-left 0 --format A4 print resume.html resume.pdf
```

Obviously you could write a very simple Node script to use the real Puppeteer and the `render` function to make a PDF without first exporting the HTML version.
